<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.</p>
<p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
<p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
<p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<p> For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
<p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</p>
<p>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>

<div class="text">
<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. </p>
<p> The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.</p>
<p>JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.</p>
<p>The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.</p>
<p>avaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.</p>
<p>You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods</p>
<p>You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.</p>
<p>Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
<code id="code-data">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");</code>

<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
<p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
With the keyword var. For example,</p>
